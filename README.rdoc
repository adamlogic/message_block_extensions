== Message Block Extensions

This is an extraction of helpers that we've used for some EdgeCase projects that work with the message_block[http://github.com/railsgarden/message_block/tree/master] plugin.

== Helper Methods

+flash_and_validation_messages+:: This wraps the call to +message_block+ with some alternative defaults. You'll normally want to stick this in a layout file.
<tt>show_validation_errors_on(models)</tt>:: Put this at the top of a view to specify which the models to show validation errors on when +flash_and_validation_messages+ is called.
